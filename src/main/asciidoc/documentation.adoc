= Introduction

The GitHub Proxy is a simple application using RestTemplate to retrieve repositories sorted by stars from the public GitHub search API.

For reference the official GitHub documentation can be found https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search[here].

== Requests

The GitHub proxy supports one *GET*-Request with several variations of request parameters.
Request parameters can be combined. Only the limit function has restrictions leading to errors.

=== Simple Request
To get started a simple request with *curl* retrieves all repositories since the date *1970-01-01*.
By default *100* repositories will be returned.

include::{snippets}/rawRequest/http-response.adoc[]

=== Response Scheme
Every response will follow the table.

include::{snippets}/rawRequest/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Request with Date
To search for a date just provide the query parameter *inceptionDate*.
Then the search will be restricted to repositories created since that date.

include::{snippets}/dateRequest/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Request with Date and language

This variation will filter repositories for date and main programming language.

include::{snippets}/dateAndLanguageRequest/curl-request.adoc[]
Parameters for the request are:
include::{snippets}/dateAndLanguageRequest/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Limits
Limits can be added but the only allowed values are 10, 50 and 100. Every other number will lead to an error.

include::{snippets}/limitRequest/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/limitRequest/response-body.adoc[]

A request with illegal values:
include::{snippets}/badLimitRequest/curl-request.adoc[]
results in a simple 400.

=== Ordering

Lastly repositories can be ordered with sortKey enums *ASC* and *DESC* for ascending and descending order respectively.

include::{snippets}/orderRequest/curl-request.adoc[]
Ordering is just one parameter.
include::{snippets}/orderRequest/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Addtional Notes and comments
The GitHub search API behaves a bit odd when you barely give it any parameters.
If you omit a *language* for example and you only provide an *inceptionDate* the results will be wildly different.

*One more note*:
I regret not mapping the responses to something better.
For REST-Docs to call real APIs is not good for building.
